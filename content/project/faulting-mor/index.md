The main goal of this project is to establish the mechanism by which magmatic processes that are variable along slowspreading
ridges determine faulting styles that are also variable along the ridge. The project also aims to investigate the
sensitivity of the mechanism to other important factors including fault lubrication due to rock alteration and extrusion and
underplating of magma.
